The purpose of this project to implement a 16-to-1 Multiplexer using Electric software with Transmission Gates and Static circuits using Electric software. The purpose of having different designs was to analyze and find the differences and similarities between them. We also used IRSIM and LTSpice to obtain the output waveform and verify our design with the 16-to-1 Mux truth table.
