The purpose of this project was to implement a 16-to-1 Multiplexer using Electric software, employing both Transmission Gate and Static circuit designs to analyze their differences and similarities. We used IRSIM and LTSpice to obtain output waveforms and verify the design against the 16-to-1 Mux truth table.
